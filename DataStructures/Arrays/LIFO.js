//Article: Understanding LIFO (Last In, First Out) in JavaScript

//The Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle is a fundamental concept in computer science and data structures. It governs the order in which elements are added and removed from a stack. In a LIFO data structure, the last element added is the first to be removed.

//Introduction to LIFO
//LIFO is akin to a stack of plates in a cafeteria. You add plates on top of each other, and when you need to remove a plate, you take it from the top. This principle is crucial in various computer science applications, including memory management, function call tracking, and implementing undo/redo functionality.

//Practical Implementation in JavaScript
//Let's implement a simple stack in JavaScript to demonstrate LIFO behavior:

class Stack {
  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
  }

  push(item) {
    this.items.push(item);
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return null;
    }
    return this.items.pop();
  }

  peek() {
    return this.isEmpty() ? null : this.items[this.items.length - 1];
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.items.length === 0;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const lifoStack = new Stack();

lifoStack.push(1);
lifoStack.push(2);
lifoStack.push(3);

console.log("Stack:", lifoStack.items);

const poppedItem = lifoStack.pop();
console.log("Popped Item:", poppedItem);
console.log("Updated Stack:", lifoStack.items);

// Conclusion
// Understanding and implementing LIFO principles in JavaScript is fundamental to building efficient algorithms and data structures. Whether managing function calls, handling undo/redo functionality, or solving various other programming challenges, LIFO is a powerful concept to have in your toolkit.
